## About
This project attempts to project the doctor deficit in Germany over the next 20 years (2024 - 2044) based on population trends and retirement age, using both current and historical data. The analysis dives further to ascertain what the result of this projection would mean for Africa.


## Project Description
The project dives into analyzing the projected doctor deficit in Germany over the next 20 years by considering factors such as population trends, retirement age, and the number of medical graduates. The analysis includes estimating the supply and demand for doctors, forecasting the doctor deficit, and visualizing the projected trends. Additionally, the implications of this doctor deficit in Germany for Africa are discussed, focusing on potential impacts such as brain drain and healthcare disparities. The task requires data collection, exploration, analysis, and visualization to understand the evolving healthcare landscape in Germany and its potential effects on Africa.


## Data Collection
The [dataset](./data) includes information on doctors in Germany, with figures on practicing doctors, retirement age, labor force, population, age distribution, and medical graduates. Key data ranges from 1960 to 2070, covering percentages, projections, and numbers. A few of the data sources had established research analysis with projected figures for some of the key variables such as mean retirement age.

## Key Insights
The number of practicing doctors in Germany has increased steadily from 301,000 in 2002 to 428,500 in 2023, with a projected growth in the coming years. Germany's population is expected to reach 85 million by 2040, while the number of medical graduates rose to 10,320 in 2021.

## Results and Graph
The projected increase in the aging population, particularly those aged 67 and above, will lead to a significant deficit of doctors in Germany over the next 20 years. The analysis shows a growing gap between the supply and demand of doctors, highlighting the need for strategic planning to address this issue.

## Implications for Africa
The projected doctor deficit in Germany may lead to increased recruitment of doctors from African countries, exacerbating brain drain and healthcare disparities. Addressing this imbalance will require international collaboration and investment in healthcare infrastructure and education in Africa.
